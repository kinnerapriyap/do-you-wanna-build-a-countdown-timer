## :scroll: Description

The aim is to be as frustrating a countdown timer as possible :)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I made [the-banka-toggle](https://github.com/kinnerapriyap/the-banka-toggle) a few weeks ago for
drag gesture animation. Since then, I've been wanting to remake it in Jetpack compose so I decided
to embed it into the Week 2 countdown timer and here it is!

Instructions for the countdown timer:

* Drag the stretchable square to set time
* The countdown starts when you lift your finger, so drag carefully :)
* You can still drag after your countdown starts, but be careful!
* If you over-drag and the square unsticks from the end, your countdown cancels, sorry :(
* You can also use the stop button to cancel, but why would you when you can just drag to unstick
  the square?
* If you want to countdown from a number larger than the middle of the screen, you're out of luck!
